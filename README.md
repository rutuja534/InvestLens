# InvestLens
InvestLens is an AI-powered platform designed to accelerate the venture capital due diligence process. It transforms a raw PowerPoint pitch deck into a comprehensive, actionable investment thesis, enabling investors to make faster, more informed screening decisions.
The end-to-end workflow is fully automated: from a secure Google OAuth login and file upload to a sophisticated analysis by the Google Gemini API. The system culminates in a professional-grade PDF report, which is uploaded to AWS S3 and delivered directly to the user's inbox via a SendGrid email notification.
