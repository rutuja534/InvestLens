    As an expert investment analyst, your task is to analyze the following text extracted from a startup's pitch deck. 
    Evaluate the pitch deck against the nine predefined categories.
    The output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown backticks.

    The pitch deck text is as follows:
    ---
    ${text}
    ---

    Based on the text, provide a detailed analysis in the following JSON format:
    {
      "investmentRecommendation": "A string value of 'Strong Buy', 'Hold', or 'Pass'",
      "overallScore": "An integer between 0 and 100, calculated as a weighted average of the category scores.",
      "confidenceScore": "An integer between 0 and 100, reflecting your certainty in this analysis based on the completeness and coherence of the provided text.",
      "strengths": [
        "A bullet point string of a key positive finding.",
        "A bullet point string of another key positive finding.",
        "A bullet point string of a third key positive finding."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "A bullet point string of a key risk or gap.",
        "A bullet point string of another key risk or gap.",
        "A bullet point string of a third key risk or gap."
      ],
